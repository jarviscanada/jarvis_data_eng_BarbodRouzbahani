# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Greetings! I am a 23-year-old developer located in Guelph, Ontario (willing to relocate!), and I love to help people using the skills I have! I have a Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Guelph, and I am passionate about designing and developing websites. In my programming journey so far, I have learned to program in JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, Java, and C, and have had the privilege of learning and working with technologies like Angular, Node/Express, and Docker. In addition to these, I have React, Photoshop (for UI), and MongoDB on my goals list to become better at what I like to do! I am also interested in the design and the artistic parts of a project besides the technical part, since doing art (sketching) is one of my hobbies. This means that I could be of great help when it comes to the UI of a project!
