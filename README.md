# Barbod Rouzbahani . Jarvis Consulting

I am Barbod, almost 23 years old, and I love to help people using the skills I have. I have a Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Guelph, and I am passionate about designing and developing websites. JavaScript is the language I am the most proficient at, since most of the personal projects I have done so far use JavaScript as their main language (along with HTML/CSS). In terms of front-end knowledge, I am familiar with Angular as I have used it in one project so far, and the technologies I use for the back-end are Express and SQL. Besides the technical part of the project, I am also interested in the designing and artistic parts, since doing art (sketching) is one of my hobbies. This means that I could be of great help when it comes to the UI of a project as well!
